So, here is my last post before the second evaluation. If you have been following `my blog`_ or the `octave blog`_, you know that the purpose of this google summer of code project is to create an `Interactive Tool for Single Input Single Output (SISO) Linear Control System Design`_. Also, well-known as sisotool in matlab control system desgin toolbox.

Since my last evaluation results on June 15th, it has passed 3 or 4 weeks, counting the evaluation week. In the meantime, I was able to code a significant work about *Edit Controller Windows*. It resulted in two posts. The first post was regarding the evaluation week as well as my mentorsÂ´ feedback and the actions I took from it, such as improving the coding comments, software documentation, and adding menu functionalities for all interfaces. Lastly, the second post was an introduction to the *Edit Compensantor Dynamics*, as you can go over in the following links:

- `Edit Compensantor Dynamics`_.
- `Back to Coding`_.

This last week I have continued working on Edit Compensantor Dynamics to which I added more functionlities. Now the user is able to:

- Adjust the gain of the controller by the edit box input;
- Change the location of the real zeros and poles;
- Change the location of the complex zeros and poles (imaginary part and real part);
- Change the damping and frequency of the complex zero and poles.

Here is a video where I explain how to install/run and use the sisotool:

The tool is already entirely suficient to desing a compensator. With the help of the adding/dragging fuctionlity, we can adjust the controller to the desired performance. Additionally, we can use the Edit Compensator Dynamics to enter with the desired point.

Next Steps
##########

For the next steps, we have the following list of tasks:

- Missing Add Pole/Zero in Compensator Editor;
- Add Feedback Control Architectures (https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ug/feedback-control-architectures.html);
- Add multiple controller options;
- Replace Slider Gain of the Main function (because the right way to perform this task is by dragging the closed-loop eigenvalues);
- Complete documentation.
